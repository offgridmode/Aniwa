# Current Version

```text
v0.1.1
```

---

# Why Aniwa?

Modern data workflows constantly involve:

```text
unknown datasets
```

Before trusting a dataset, teams need to answer questions like:

- What columns exist?
- What data types are present?
- Are there missing values?
- Are there duplicates?
- Are there suspicious patterns?
- Which columns may contain IDs or sensitive information?
- Is the dataset healthy?

Aniwa makes answering those questions:

```text
fast, intelligent, and developer-friendly
```
